# MachineLearningVisualization


In my senior high school, I took a machine learning course online, but unfortunately didn't finish it. 
However, I was fascinated by how the mathematics of gradient descent worked for multivariable linear regression and I wanted to make a program on it.

This is that program that visualizes how credit percent functions from a visual perspective so that it makes more sense to people who don't understand it hopefully.


When you open up the program there is two inputs

learning rate
- this is the amount that the function will change a.k.a. how much does a function take a step to the local optima.
- for ever for higher power polynomials I recommend that you choose a very small learning rate like 0.000000000001, otherwise, it will diverge to infinity.

# of iterations.
